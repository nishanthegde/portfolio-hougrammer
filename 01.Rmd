## The (Non)Software Engineer

In many ways, mechanical engineers are just glorified jigsaw puzzle solvers.  Often times, our job is to take from a virtually infinite number of puzzle pieces and put them together in a way that is not only functionally useful but also cost-effective.  If we're lucky, things fit together nicely and no pieces are missing from the box.  But more often than not, we have to craft our own pieces--hence the "design" portion of mechanical design.

In any modern company, virtually all mechanical design work is done with computer aided design (CAD) software.  This codification of the physical parts into 1s and 0s generates a lot of data.  In what Anderson calls the "Petabyte Age" [@anderson_end_2008], we are now approaching computing capabilities that can transform this CAD data into something even more exciting.  By labeling mechanical designs, we can train machine learning algorithms to do design work automatically.  If the algorithm notices that every "car" I design needs a component called a "door", maybe it can learn what a "door" is and do the design for me.  Time between concept and production falls precipitously and fewer engineers can handle more intricate tasks.  The implications for business/engineering environments are huge.

## The Paradigm Shift

To be clear, I am not proposing a giant repository of mechanical designs for engineers to pick previously designed parts.  The real strength of a machine learning algorithm lies not in its ability to regurgitate previous inputs, but rather in its ability to learn and adapt to new problems.  If the algorithm outputs a poor design, it can learn a better a solution.  Maybe you wanted a sliding door rather than a hinged one.  Configure your cost function to penalize rotational designs more than translational ones.  The algortihm will start by trying to push square pegs into round holes. But as it evolves, not only will it learn round pegs, it may start pointing out how the hole doesn't even need to be filled.

Of course, my vision for an ML algorithm to suggest completely novel designs may be beyond the capabilities of current or even near-future computing power.  There obviously needs to be an evolution of complexity for the software.  I'm proposing a few levels of functionality:

1. Component suggestion.  The algorithm can suggest previously designed components for use in the current design but the actual implementation is left up to the engineer.  E.g. suggesting bolt sizes for sheet metal.
2. Geometry suggestion.  The algorithm suggests previously designed components as well as their geometry.  E.g. suggesting a water routing path.
3. Design suggestion.  The algorithm designs new geometry as a new solution for a specified problem.  E.g. suggesting a fixture to hold a cantilevered weight in place while someone for a plasma chamber maintenance (a real design project of mine)

Level 1 suggestion is starting to emerge experimentally in some CAD packages, showing that development has started on what Fuge describes as "Computation Design Synthesis" [@fuge_collaborative_2014].  My description of level 3 suggestion may not have been very elucidating, but it is also the hardest one to encapsulate.  The idea of "design suggestion" can be extended almost ad infinitum.  It is perceivable (albeit in a science-fictionish way) that this algorithm could advance one day to the point where an engineer can simply say, "design me an electric car," and receive drawings for something akin to a Tesla.

## Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks

My present reveries aside, an algorithm for design does face many challenges.  At least in the present day, adoption is a significant roadblock.  Going to work with many experienced (read older) MEs every day, it is difficult enough to get them to switch over to Chrome from Internet Explorer, let alone adopt an entirely new design paradigm.  There will be growing pains, as mechanical engineers learn to deal with not only detailing their design intent to their managers but also to a computer--and the latter often requires much more coddling.

And there is always the question of who really deserves the credit for an algorithm's designs?  Is it the people who produced the inputs or the ones that shaped the algorithm, tuning the neuron weights and network architecture?  Or perhaps it is the end user?  Modern companies are already very tight-lipped about their proprietary designs (a certain fruit immediately comes to mind).  Maybe, automatic design algorithms will never cross chasm between different companies and design firms.  But, it is fun to imagine a world where there is an algorithm containing the knowledge of the worldwide engineering collective.  Would the iPhones in that world would have headphone jacks?
