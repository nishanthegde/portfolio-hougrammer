# Sanitizing Engineering Data {#slug-one}

#### Keywords {-}

For saving data scientists from headaches later

## A beginning.

Often times, data coming from research & development projects are littered poor formatting and random notes.  Whether performed by a dedicated data analyst or the original engineer, sanitation of the data is required before it is of much use.

## A middle.

Whether by simply training them or by using standalone software, we need to help nudge engineers in correct direction of taking clean data from the very beginning.  Disallow the hodgepodge of Excel tables, littered with incorrect data types and arbitrary text notes.  We want clean sets of data that can be easily loaded and analyzed.

## An end.

Data collection (or at least the actions leading up to it) may take a bit longer in the beginning, but the return on time investment will show quickly, when engineers can start producing better reports with smaller effort.
