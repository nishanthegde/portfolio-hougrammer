<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The First Big Decision in Life</h2>
<p>It is ludicrous that the American education system expects fresh high school graduates to possess enough foresight to make an accurate decision about a college major, which could dictate their entire careers. Many students (estimates range from 20 to 50 percent) choose to simply delay choice of major and enter college as undecided, with even more changing major at least once before leaving school <span class="citation">(Gordon <a href="ML-Majors.html#ref-gordon_undecided_1995">1995</a>)</span>. Changes in major are costly, both in money and time, with only 19 percent of students in 2014 completing their bachelor’s degree in four years <span class="citation">(Lewin <a href="ML-Majors.html#ref-lewin_most_2014">2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Even with a single concrete major, from admittance day to graduation day, students will not necessarily transition into a long and prosperous career in a related field. According to a 2013 Reuters’ poll, “only 14 percent of US workers believe they have have the perfect job and half want to change careers”. The same poll claims that a staggering 80 percent of workers in their 20s would like to change careers <span class="citation">(Reuters <a href="ML-Majors.html#ref-reuters_poll_2013">2013</a>)</span>. Many young professionals find themselves unhappy with their choice of occupation and return to school for graduate studies. Wouldn’t it be nice if students had some guidance, early in their college careers, in choosing a major that is less likely to cause them turmoil throughout the remainder of their educational and vocational lives?</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Like Netflix Recommendations But For School</h2>
<p>I propose we build a recommender system for college majors. Depending on a student’s academic background–i.e. performance in various classes–an algorithm can recommend field(s) of study, seeking to minimize the number of major changes and maximize future occupational satisfaction. Of these two cost function contributors, the former is easier to measure, but the latter may be much more useful. Operationalizing career satisfaction is difficult, but can be done through a combination of direct surveys on industry professionals and indirect measurements on metrics like turnover rate.</p>
<p>Of course, academic background should not be the only factor in decision of a major. There are way more variables that influence career satisfaction than can be enumerated here (e.g. work-life balance, career stability, etc.). The most interesting inputs are aspects of student personality but are probably also the hardest ones to translate into a machine-readable representation. To truly gain insight into a student’s interests, we can tap into social media and web browsing behavior to create a profile of the student, similar to ones already built for targetted advertising.</p>
<p>With the advent of deep learning, we can make such profiles sophisticated enough to recommend majors that the student never even considered. Many personality profile patterns are not even understandable to humans but can be represented as nodes in a neural network. The algorithm could predict major changes before they even enter the student’s mind. As an anecdotal aside, my roommate in college entered studying piano performance and left with a computer science degree. The drastic difference in the two areas of study meant that his graduation was delayed despite spending extra time and money making up classes each summer. A sophisticated machine learning algorithm can help predict which students are likely to make such a switch in major and short circuit the process altogether.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that the algorithm should suggest majors best suited for the student and not ones with the hottest job markets. Websites like this <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm">one</a> enumerate supposedly “best” jobs and even give satisfaction ratings. And perhaps those that are well-suited for the related fields of study on such lists really should aspire for these positions. However, besides the managerial positions, the list is heavily dominated by STEM fields due to the high salaries and number of openings. The algorithm should take more than these factors into account and not just suggest engineering as a major for everyone. We want the algorithm to figure out when a student would be truly suited to pursuing a degree in liberal arts, even if it means the job market is less than ideal.</p>

<div id="two-endings-to-the-story" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Two Endings to the Story</h2>
<p>It is easy to imagine two diverging paths leading from the adoption of a major recommender algorithm: a dystopian one where machines dictate people’s positions in life and an (almost) utopian one where every person finds a truly fulfilling occupation. The key factor distinguishing the former from the latter is choice. The proposed algorithms are simply meant to be suggestions and it is ultimately up to students to make informed decisions with the tools available to them. For many students, major changes are not only inevitable but beneficial. College should be a time of exploration and many students need to study a variety of subjects to fully realize their future aspirations. However, it is undeniable that with each semester comes another tuition bill. Anything that can help optimize and shorten a student’s path to graduation should be considered. At the very least, we can help alleviate analysis paralysis for high school seniors who feel no excitement for any major.</p>
