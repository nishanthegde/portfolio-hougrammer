## The First Big Decision in Life

It is ludicrous that the American education system expects fresh high school graduates to possess enough foresight to make an accurate decision about a college major, which could dictate their entire careers.  Many students (estimates range from 20 to 50 percent) choose to simply delay choice of major and enter college as undecided, with even more changing major at least once before leaving school [@gordon_undecided_1995].  Changes in major are costly, both in money and time, with only 19 percent of students in 2014 completing their bachelor's degree in four years [@lewin_most_2014].

Even with a single concrete major, from admittance day to graduation day, students will not necessarily transition into a long and prosperous career in a related field.  According to a 2013 Reuters' poll, "only 14 percent of US workers believe they have have the perfect job and half want to change careers".  The same poll claims that a staggering 80 percent of workers in their 20s would like to change careers [@reuters_poll_2013]. Many young professionals find themselves unhappy with their choice of occupation and return to school for graduate schooling.  Wouldn't it be nice if students had some guidance, early in their college careers, in how to choose a major that is less likely to cause them turmoil throughout the remainder of their educational and vocational lives?

## Like Netflix Recommendations But For School

With the increasing digitization of educational and occupational data, I propose we build a major recommender system for incoming college freshmen.  Depending on a student's academic background--i.e. good or bad performance in various classes--an algorithm can automatically recommend field(s) of study which minimize the number of major changes and maximizes future occupational satisfaction.  Of these two cost function contributors, the former is easier to measure, but the latter may be much more useful.  Operationalizing career satisfaction is difficult to do, but can be done through a combination of direct surveys on industry professionals and indirect measurements on metrics like turnover rate.

Of course, a student's academic background should not be the only factor in his or her decision of a major.  There are way more variables that can influence career satisfaction (e.g. work-life balance, career stability, etc.) than can be enumerated here.  The most interesting inputs are aspects of student personalities and they are probably also the hardest ones to translate into a digital representation.  To truly gain insight into a student's interest, we can tap into social media and web browsing behavior to create a profile of the student.  If Facebook can make targeted ads seemingly tailored to individuals, we can create algorithms to suggest majors in the same vain.  Eventually, the algorithm can recommend majors that the student does not even consider.  As a purely anecdotal piece of evidence, my roommate in college entered as a music performance major and left as a computer science major.  The drastic difference in the two areas of study meant that despite spending extra time and money making up classes each summer, his graduation was still delayed.  Hopefully, a machine learning algorithm can help predict which students are likely to make such a switch in major and short circuit the process altogether.

It is important to point out that we want to build an algorithm that suggest majors best suited for the student and not ones with the hottest job markets.  Websites like this [one](https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm) enumerate supposedly "best" jobs and even give satisfaction ratings to go along.  And perhaps those students that are well-suited for the related fields of study on such lists really should aspire for those positions. However, outside the managerial positions, the list is heavily dominated by STEM fields due to the high salaries and number of openings.  The algorithm should take more than these factors into account and not just suggest a future where everyone is an engineer.  We want the algorithm to figure out when a student would be truly suited to pursuing a degree in liberal arts, even if it means the job market is less than ideal.

## Two Endings to the Story

It is easy to imagine two diverging paths leading from the adoption of a major recommender algorithm: a dystopian one where machines dictate people's positions in life and an (almost) utopian one where every person finds a truly fulfilling occupation.  The key factor in moving from the former to the latter is choice.  The proposed algorithms are simply meant to be suggestions and it is ultimately up to students to make informed decisions with the tools available to them.  For many students, major changes are not only inevitable but beneficial.  College should be a time of exploration and many students need to study a variety of subjects to fully realize their future aspirations.  However, it is undeniable that with each semester comes another tuition bill and more time spent.  Anything that can help optimize and shorten a student's path should be considered.  At the very least, we can help alleviate analysis paralysis for those high school seniors that feel every major is terrible.
